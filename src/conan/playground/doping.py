class OptimizationWeights(NamedTuple):
    """
    Represents the weights used in the optimization of nitrogen doping to achieve the desired nitrogen percentage while
    maintaining an equal distribution among species.

    In the linear programming model, the objective function is: Minimize w1 * z1 + w2 * z2, where z1 represents the
    absolute deviation from the desired total nitrogen percentage and z2 represents the absolute deviation from an equal
    distribution of nitrogen atoms among the different species.

    Attributes
    ----------
    nitrogen_percentage_weight : float
        Weight for the deviation from the desired nitrogen percentage (w1).
    equal_distribution_weight : float
        Weight for the deviation from equal distribution among species (w2).

    Notes
    -----
    * Effects of high w1 and w2 values:

        High nitrogen_percentage_weight: The optimization will prioritize achieving the desired nitrogen percentage so
        that the solution will closely match the desired nitrogen percentage, potentially at the expense of an equal
        distribution of nitrogen atoms among species.

        High equal_distribution_weight: The optimization will prioritize achieving an equal distribution of nitrogen
        atoms among species, potentially at the expense of deviating from the desired nitrogen percentage.

    * Trade-off between w1 and w2:

        Balancing Act: Adjusting w1 and w2 allows you to balance between achieving the exact nitrogen percentage and
        maintaining an equal distribution among species.

        Scenario Examples:
         - w1 >> w2: Focus on matching the nitrogen percentage; distribution among species is less critical.
         - w2 >> w1: Focus on equal distribution; some deviation from the nitrogen percentage is acceptable.
         - w1 â‰ˆ w2: The model seeks a compromise between the two objectives.
