ANALYSIS mode.

These functions are limited to rigid/frozen pores containing undistorted CNTs.
(1) Calculate the radial density inside the CNT
(2) Calculate the radial charge density inside the CNT (if charges are provided)
(3) Calculate the radial velocity of the liquid in the CNT.
(4) Calculate the accessibe volume of the CNT
(5) Calculate the axial density along the z axis of the simulation box,  with the accessible volume of the CNT considered.
(6) Calculate the maximal/minimal distance between the liquid and pore atoms

These functions are generally applicable.
(7) Calculate the coordination number
(8) Calculate the density along the axes.
